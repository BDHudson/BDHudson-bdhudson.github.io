This is a first and foremost a work in progress. I plan on using this blog to present work as it is developing. If you want to see truly polished work, please see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xGrJLIcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate/) profile. 

I also plan on presenting non-research related topics.
