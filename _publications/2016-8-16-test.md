title: Testing Jekyll Now 
---

One of the most attractive points about using github to host my website is that I can have the code and other content in one place. In the spirit of open, fully reproducable science, I plan on periodically updating a range of research projects on this website.  Its also amazing at how easy Jekyll Now makes all of this!

```python
# this is an example properly rendered python code 
import numpy as np

test_np = np.zeros((3,3))
```
