title: PostDoc to Data Science Cooperative

### 

Only XX percent of post-docs move onto tenure track jobs. Often instead they bounce between various forms of non-tenure track work. 

Worse yet with time stress can eat away at their confidence

"about 65% of US PhD-holders continue into a postdoc, only 15â€“20% of those move into tenure-track academic posts."

### data science demand

### existing options are limited or expensive, potentially not necessary

I for one still think that the term data science redunant  - that you can't be a scientist without data. But I also recongize that the field is in its youth (and might be compared to being described as a 'webmaster' back in the 1990s). it is a catch all, ill defined field. It involves the scale of data, etc. that makes it unique.

Options for retrainning assume programs have some secret sauce to offer that post-docs don't already have.

### Self help 

My assessment of the situation is that postdocs have the skills, but that they are irregularly developed in post-docs. Where research requires skills, they are very well developed. Collectively, put together a room of 20 post docs - and all the necessary skills exist in abundance. 

The need is to: 

1) spread out theses skills to other postdocs through teaching (we all know something) 
1a) find other ways to get these skills, such as through MOOCs, the eScience Institute, etc. 
2) get real world experience (at least as robust as the data science for good program)  
3) network with industry

### The Goal 

My proposal to the eScience Institute is such: 

1) Form an interest group of post-docs
2) Give them a forum to educate each other
3) Use their skill and interest to push forward data science for social good projects during the 'offseason'.

After a [DSSG project](http://escience.washington.edu/data-science-for-social-good-projects/
) concludes work does continue. However,postdocs could be used to supercharge the projects.

Post docs would comit to spending a ceratain number of hours a week/month. They wou then get supported by eScience in some capacity (but mostly from each other)
